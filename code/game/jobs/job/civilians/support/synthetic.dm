Aside from that, you may carry out other functions, such as helping out, socializing, and generally roleplaying as you see fit. Just remember to keep the lights on.
You must obey the chain of command: Outpost Commander followed by the Adjunct Officer. Command may assign additional duties for you, so do keep an ear out.
You are not required to follow orders that are clearly dangerous to yourself or others, nonsensical, impossible, or made under duress, even if they come from proper chain of command.

Prioritize orders from those higher on the chain of command. In case of conflicting orders, those higher on the chain of command take priority.
Civilian guests are to be treated on the level of senior enlisted personnel (sergeant and above)."}
